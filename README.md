  LifeDeathProbability.txt    (text file contailing the likliness of death at each age per sex)

## Introduction
Book practice project from Problem Solving With C++ Chapter 7. Project 20.
write a program that determines when the user will likely die, based on an input of their sex and age. Demonstrates ability to read in files and use randomizing functions in c++.
Written using Microsoft Visual Studio. 

## Algorithm

		1. read in death likelihood from file
		2. get user input of age and sex
		3. randomly determine age user will die
		4. output age to screen

## Requirements
No requirements or modules needed for running this program.
